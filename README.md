# Texas German Dialect Tools
Tools for the [Texas German Dialect Project](www.tgdp.org). 

Includes the [Downloader](https://github.com/tgdp/tgdp/blob/master/summer16/downloader/README.MD), the [Corpusbuilder](https://github.com/tgdp/tgdp/blob/master/summer16/corpusbuilder/README.MD) and various [Gilbert tools](https://github.com/tgdp/tgdp/blob/master/summer16/gilberttools/README.md). 

## Get started
The software you need is already installed on your computer or available for free. 

Here is how to set up your Mac or [Windows](https://github.com/tgdp/tools/blob/master/setup_windows.MD) computer before running the scripts for the first time. 

All the scripts are written in Python. Here are instructions how to run them on a Mac and on Windows after you have performed the steps described in setup above. 

## Scenarios
I need to download a lot of files from the TGDP database! Use the [Downloader](https://github.com/tgdp/tgdp/blob/master/summer16/downloader/README.MD).

I have a lot of TGDP recordings and want to extract all recordings from a specific location! Use the [Corpusbuilder](https://github.com/tgdp/tgdp/blob/master/summer16/corpusbuilder/README.MD)

I want to extract all recordings from male speakers, speakers born before 1923, or everyone who is not from a specific location! The [Corpusbuilder](https://github.com/tgdp/tgdp/blob/master/summer16/corpusbuilder/README.MD) can do all of that. 

I have a lot of wordlist recordings. I want to extract all items that contain the sound / Å/! Use the [Gilbert finder](https://github.com/tgdp/tgdp/blob/master/summer16/gilberttools/README.md). 

I have a lot of wordlist recordings. I want to extract all items that contain a specific word and are less than two words long! Use the [Gilbert finder](https://github.com/tgdp/tgdp/blob/master/summer16/gilberttools/README.md).
