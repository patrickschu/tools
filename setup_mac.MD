#Setting up your Mac

##1. Python is already installed on your computer.

##2. Make sure you know how to run Python in the Terminal. 
Open the Terminal (search your *Applications* folder for "Terminal.app") and type `python`. 
This will start Python. Type `exit()` to quit. To find out which version of Python you are running, type `python -V`. 


##3. Install the *pandas* and *Beautiful Soup* packages. 
- Make sure you have completed step 3. 
- Open your command prompt. 
- type
`easy_install --user pandas`

  This installs [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). 

- then type
`easy_install --user  beautifulsoup4`

  This installs [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). 
  
  This video walks you through the process. 

##4. You're good to go.
